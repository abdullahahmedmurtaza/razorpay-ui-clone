A pixel-perfect clone of the [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) website interface, created using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project focuses on **UI development** and **responsive design**. Functionality with JavaScript will be added in future updates.

> ⚠️ Note: This clone is based on an **earlier version** of Razorpay’s website UI. Razorpay has since updated their design, but this project still demonstrates pixel-perfect cloning, responsive layouts, and Tailwind CSS best practices.

## 💡 Learnings & Reflections
- 🌀 I preferred **Tailwind CSS** over vanilla CSS because it is faster, much easier to use, and saved me a lot of time.  
- ⚡ That said, this project involved a lot of **hit-and-trial** to get the exact pixel values correct. This wasted quite a bit of time — in future projects, I realize it’s wiser to use **UI design tools (like Figma)** before coding.  
- 🤖 I also used **ChatGPT** whenever I got stuck. It was super helpful in debugging and understanding concepts quickly.
